The HR Analysis Project focuses on analyzing employee data to understand workforce trends, performance, and attrition. The goal is to help HR teams make data-driven decisions on hiring, employee retention, and engagement strategies.

Using Power BI, this project visualizes HR metrics such as employee distribution, departmental performance, attrition rates, and key KPIs to provide actionable insights for workforce management.

🎯 Objectives

Evaluate employee demographics (age, gender, education).

Analyze employee attrition and identify high-risk groups.

Examine salary distribution, experience levels, and performance ratings.

Compare department-wise performance and turnover.

Build an interactive dashboard for HR insights and reporting.

📊 Key Metrics (KPIs)
KPI	Description
Total Employees	Total number of active employees
Attrition Count	Number of employees who left
Attrition Rate (%)	Percentage of employees who left
Average Age	Mean age of employees
Average Salary	Mean salary across roles or departments
Years at Company	Average tenure of employees
Gender Diversity Ratio	Male-to-female ratio
Department Attrition	Attrition percentage per department
🧠 Key Insights

Young employees (age < 30) have higher turnover rates.

Departments like R&D and Sales exhibit the highest attrition.

Employees with higher salaries and longer tenure are less likely to leave.

Job satisfaction is a key factor influencing retention.

Gender diversity is balanced in most departments, but leadership roles can be improved.

⚙️ Tools & Technologies

Power BI – Dashboard creation and visualization

Power Query – Data cleaning and transformation

DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) – KPI and metric calculations

Excel / CSV – HR dataset source

(Optional) SQL / Python – Data preprocessing

🧮 Sample DAX Measures
Total Employees = COUNT(HR[EmployeeID])

Attrition Count = CALCULATE(
    COUNT(HR[EmployeeID]),
    HR[Attrition] = "Yes"
)

Attrition Rate (%) = DIVIDE([Attrition Count], [Total Employees], 0) * 100

Average Salary = AVERAGE(HR[MonthlyIncome])

Average Tenure = AVERAGE(HR[YearsAtCompany])
